    "TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation)": {
        "Description": "Uses low-frequency currents to relieve pain. Electrodes are placed on the skin in the affected area, and the current stimulates nerves, blocking pain signals and releasing endorphins.",
        "Indications": [
            "Acute pain",
            "Chronic pain",
            "Muscle and joint injuries"
        ]
    },
    "EMS (Electrical Muscle Stimulation)": {
        "Description": "Applies electrical currents to provoke muscle contractions. It is used to strengthen weakened muscles, prevent muscle atrophy, and improve circulation.",
        "Indications": [
            "Post-surgical recovery",
            "Muscle atrophy",
            "Sports injuries"
        ]
    },
    "Interferential Currents": {
        "Description": "Uses two medium-frequency currents that intersect in the affected area, producing an interference that stimulates deeper tissues.",
        "Benefits": [
            "Pain relief",
            "Reduces inflammation",
            "Improves circulation"
        ],
        "Indications": [
            "Lower back pain",
            "Cervical pain",
            "Chronic pain"
        ]
    },
    "Galvanic Currents": {
        "Description": "Uses continuous low-intensity currents to treat inflammation and stimulate blood circulation. Effective for edema treatment.",
        "Indications": [
            "Ulcer treatment",
            "Soft tissue stimulation",
            "Muscle injuries"
        ]
    },
    "Therapeutic Ultrasound": {
        "Description": "Emits high-frequency sound waves to heat deep tissues and promote cell regeneration. Often used alongside electrotherapy.",
        "Indications": [
            "Tendinitis",
            "Bursitis",
            "Muscle contractures"
        ]
    },
    "High-Frequency Currents (Microwave and Shortwave)": {
        "Description": "Uses high-frequency waves to heat deep tissues, improve circulation, and reduce pain.",
        "Indications": [
            "Arthritis",
            "Muscle contractures",
            "Tendinitis"
        ]
    },
    "Iontophoresis": {
        "Description": "Uses continuous currents to introduce medications into the body through the skin. Useful for reducing inflammation and relieving localized pain.",
        "Indications": [
            "Localized inflammation",
            "Joint injuries",
            "Tendinitis"
        ]
